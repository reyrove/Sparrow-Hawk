Welcome to the **Artworks** section of the **Sparrow Hawk** repository. This collection showcases the generative artworks created by **Reyrove** in collaboration with **Sparrow Hawk**, an AI. Each piece is minted as an NFT on the **fxhash platform**, using **p5.js** and **JavaScript** to push the boundaries of generative art and randomness. 

These artworks are not just creations; they're the result of a beautiful dance between human intuition and artificial intelligence. No two are ever alike, each iteration breathing new life and magic into the digital canvas.
